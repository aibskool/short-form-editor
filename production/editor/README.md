# Original-footage reel editor

This local editing foundation preserves Samin's recorded picture and voice. It uses pinned **HyperFrames 0.8.27**, HeyGen's open-source HTML/GSAP video renderer, to assemble source cuts, captions, split screens, full-screen visuals, zooms, instrumental music and sound accents. It does not create an avatar, replace speech, upload footage, or call a paid video API.

## Run

Requires Python 3.9+, Node 22+, FFmpeg/FFprobe, and a Chrome runtime. From this directory:

```bash
npm ci
python3 edit.py build --spec timeline.json --project /absolute/path/to/composition
./node_modules/.bin/hyperframes check /absolute/path/to/composition --at 1,5,10 --json
./node_modules/.bin/hyperframes snapshot /absolute/path/to/composition --at 1,5,10 --no-end --describe false
python3 edit.py render --project /absolute/path/to/composition --output /absolute/path/to/pilot.mp4 --quality standard --workers 1
```

Review snapshots before the full render. `--describe false` keeps snapshot images out of optional external vision analysis. The build writes `index.html`, the editable input timeline, mapped word timings, and a build receipt. Rendering writes a probe receipt after verifying the MP4. Then run `python3 ../finalize_render.py --input /absolute/path/to/raw.mp4 --output /absolute/path/to/final.mp4 --receipt /absolute/path/to/verification.json` to normalize the actual mixed audio, decode the entire final file and record its hash/loudness. Use a new final output path; existing versions are preserved. Local media is hardlinked when possible and copied otherwise; keep source files unchanged while editing.

Use a 720×1280 proxy for the first visual pass or 1080×1920 for final delivery. The source may be portrait or landscape; `object_position` controls the authored crop. This is not automatic face tracking. Start with one render worker on memory-constrained machines; two is a reasonable initial choice for this 16 GB M1 Pro. Four may increase memory pressure. HyperFrames can download its Chrome runtime on the first render and cache it for later runs; dependencies/fonts can also require initial network access.

## Timeline contract

`timeline.example.json` is a renderer capability demo, not the Council production template: its generic text cards demonstrate fields, not preferred B-roll. Use the plugin's shot recipes and caption preset for production. All paths resolve relative to that JSON file. `source.segments` is an ordered list of kept source ranges in seconds; picture, original audio, and supplied word timings follow the same cuts. Omit it to use the whole provided clip.

`words_path` accepts a word array, `{ "words": [...] }`, or Whisper-style `{ "segments": [{ "words": [...] }] }`. Every word needs `word` (or `text`), `start`, and `end`, in source-video seconds. Correct names and transcription errors before rendering. A trimmed proxy should normally have word times rebased to zero.

Shots use output-time seconds and one of three layouts:

- `presenter`: full portrait A-roll, with optional fixed `zoom`, `x_percent`, and `y_percent`.
- `split`: top-half visual and bottom-half presenter.
- `full_broll`: full-screen visual while Samin's source audio continues.

For visual shots, use `media` for a local image/video or `graphic` for an explicitly labelled conceptual illustration. SVG remains vector artwork in the browser. Image/video `fit`, `source_start`, and `background` are configurable; `media_zoom: 1.04` adds a slow 1×→1.04× zoom over the shot. `caption_y` sets the caption block's top as a percentage per shot. A graphics card can contain an eyebrow, title, label/text cards, and footer. Do not label diagrams as real software outputs.

Caption defaults use heavy white uppercase groups, dark shadow and transparent backing in every layout. Use the plugin's explicit caption preset to match the supplied reference; generic defaults alone do not set its size, phrasing or emphasis. The adapted Council caption preset sets `accent` to green (`#49cf26`), but words receive it only through `captions.emphasis` or a word-level emphasis flag. Explicit `phrases` override automatic `max_words`/`max_chars` grouping, so inspect their lengths independently. A dark `captions.background` is an opt-in for a justified contrast problem. There is no yellow karaoke tracking. Exact font identification remains uncertain: Arial Black is an approximation. Set `font_path` to a licensed local font for a reproducible render.

`zooms` accepts output-time `{ "at": 5, "scale": 1.1, "duration": 0.16 }` entries. `sfx` accepts a supplied local audio path or the original, synthesized `soft_pop` accent, with `at` and a calibrated `gain`. Samin reels require music; the plugin build entrypoint rejects a missing policy/track unless an explicit user opt-out is recorded. Low-level legacy compositions can still omit music, so use the plugin entrypoint for production.

## Verification receipt

Run `python3 test_edit.py -v` for four timing/grouping tests. They cover source-cut/reorder mapping, excluded words, invalid timings, and phrase breaks. A synthetic four-second smoke render was verified as H.264 + AAC, 360×640, 30 fps, with 391,729 bytes; an extracted MP4 frame confirmed the captions and split graphic survived encoding. Rendering took 24.3 seconds after the initial browser download. That test is a renderer check, not the filmed pilot.

HyperFrames checks passed with zero errors and warnings for both the initial native-graphic composition and a second SVG composition with slow zoom. Informational overflow findings reflect deliberate camera crops. Real footage still needs its own caption, crop, source-claim, and audio review.

## Tool choice and current API findings

Checked September 4, 2026 against primary documentation:

- [HyperFrames official repository](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes) documents local HTML/CSS/media composition, deterministic browser capture, and FFmpeg encoding under Apache 2.0. Its [creator editing recipes](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes/blob/main/skills/hyperframes-core/references/creator-editing-recipes.md) support source trims, matched audio cuts, crop wrappers, and zooms. This is the chosen engine.
- [HeyGen Studio API](https://developers.heygen.com/studio-videos) composes whole-frame scenes through `POST /v3/videos` with `type: "studio"`. Its documented caption source coverage and single-scene layout do not establish this exact simultaneous split-screen A-roll editing workflow.
- [HeyGen AI Clipping API](https://developers.heygen.com/ai-clipping) accepts source video and can create captioned highlight clips. It uses HeyGen authentication and account billing; no such job was submitted here.
- [HeyGen's developer entry point](https://developers.heygen.com/) documents API-key and OAuth CLI routes. No HeyGen CLI was present on PATH during inspection. The local HyperFrames route needs no HeyGen login or subscription purchase.

The current machine has Node 22.23.1, FFmpeg 8.0.1, and cached Chrome. HyperFrames doctor reported optional Docker and local TTS unavailable; neither is required for original-footage local rendering. The installed FFmpeg build lacks `drawtext`/`subtitles`, so captions are rendered in the browser instead.

## Fast motion and semantic captions

`output.split_fraction` controls the measured split seam (pilot 0.4648). `captions.phrases` can define complete, ordered `word_range: [start,endExclusive]` spans, relative `line_breaks`, mixed-case `lead_in` and progressive second-line reveals. The builder rejects omitted or duplicated words. Five tests include phrase coverage. Caption text can omit terminal punctuation while the spoken transcript stays intact.

A shot may use `scene` instead of `media`: the original prompt workspace in `motion_scenes.py` animates real giveaway prompt excerpts with typed text, role tabs and scrolling. It is visibly labeled PROMPT DEMO; it is not a screen recording of Claude. `kind: prompt_scroll` and `block_layout: grid` are optional. `flashes` adds brief, low-opacity radial transition light leaks. The pilot's `sfx/` folder contains a deterministic generator, four original WAVs and their measurement/provenance index. Actual product recordings can be substituted through `media` without changing the rest of the pipeline.

## Evidence-driven inserts

V2 adds `media_crop: [x,y,width,height]` in original source pixels. The builder verifies bounds, preserves aspect ratio, and clips the source nondestructively. Source screenshots retain their original pixels; author/date/repo identity and source limitations belong in the asset index. Use an overview followed by a meaningful close crop when a full README would be illegible on a phone. `labels` carries small timed source labels; `captions.background` overrides the transparent default.

`scene.kind: artifact_preview` shows actual filenames and exact giveaway excerpts; it is a resource preview, never a fabricated model response. Its `reveals` are deterministic text states. Use sparingly: real application/source captures take priority. The v2 reference calibration already carries its original sound effects in the A-roll audio; keep `sfx` empty to avoid doubling them.

## Required music and directed motion

Use `python3 <plugin>/scripts/reel.py run build -- --spec /absolute/timeline.json --project /absolute/composition` for Samin production edits. This gate requires `audio_policy.music_required: true` and an actual `music` entry. The only waiver is an explicit user request documented in `audio_policy.user_opt_out`; do not invent that request to bypass a missing asset. The renderer checks file existence, audio stream, timeline/source bounds and finite volume automation. Nonzero volume proves signal configuration, not perceived audibility.

A partial timeline example for a **10-second** reel (replace paths and duration):

```json
{
  "audio_policy": {"music_required": true},
  "music": [{
    "path": "audio/instrumental.wav", "start": 0, "end": 10,
    "source_start": 0, "gain": 0.26,
    "envelope": [{"t":0,"v":0.26},{"t":0.05,"v":0.34},
      {"t":4.6,"v":0.34},{"t":5.1,"v":0.26},
      {"t":9,"v":0.26},{"t":10,"v":0}]
  }]
}
```

`start`/`end` use the final reel clock. `source_start` selects the musical in-point. Envelope `t` is relative to the music clip start; `v` is its **absolute volume**, replacing `gain` during automation, not multiplying it. Values are 0–1 and times increase within clip duration. Keep the file longer than the selected interval; there is no automatic looping. Index source/license/credit and carry required credit into the publication packet. Finalize the full mixed output and listen at normal volume.

For a directed camera move, a media shot can specify `media_motion: {"from":{"scale":1.02,"x_percent":0,"y_percent":0},"to":{"scale":1.10,"x_percent":-2,"y_percent":0},"ease":"none"}`. The move is applied to the non-timed camera wrapper while the timed media and background remain compositor-controlled. It takes precedence over `media_zoom`. Positive x/y moves the media right/down. Inspect the start/middle/end; a camera move must preserve the required crop text and source context. Use native recorded motion first when it communicates the claim better.

For tightened existing speech, use `production/retime_timeline.py --help` (or plugin `run retime`). Prepare the 1× A-roll and word list first, retime outer cues, then plan music on the final clock. Recheck actions inside recordings and effect tails manually. The current worked revision is `production/pilots/mobbin-v2/`; its technical checks are distinct from perceptual approval.

The finalizer leaves 0.8 dB of pre-AAC headroom by default (`--codec-headroom-db`) while checking the requested decoded true-peak target. This accounts for codec overshoot observed with stronger transient SFX. The final decoded measurement remains authoritative; adjust headroom and re-export if `true_peak_review_needed` is true. Video packets are copied unchanged.
