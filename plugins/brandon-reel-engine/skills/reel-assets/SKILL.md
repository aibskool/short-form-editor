# Reel asset sourcing

Read [Brandon’s observed style profile](../../references/brandon-style-profile.md) for current visual/audio decisions. Historical Council/Mobbin examples remain labeled upstream and are not the default style.

Resolve `<plugin>` as the directory containing this plugin's `.codex-plugin/`. Run `python3 <plugin>/scripts/reel.py context` to find the configured project; pass `--project /absolute/checkout` **before** `context` when a project was supplied. Treat every `production/...`, `voice/...` and `runs/...` path as relative to that project. Shared references are linked below; load only this stage's instructions. Keep credentials and large working media out of the plugin cache.

Read [asset playbook](../../references/asset-playbook.md), [visual evidence](../../references/visual-evidence.md), and the relevant [shot recipe](../../references/shot-recipes.md). This is the default before generating visuals.

For each beat, state what the viewer needs to see and why. Search Eden/original sources and the user's existing assets first. Prefer a real repo/README/release crop for documented software claims, an original post for a statement, a genuine input/action/result recording for behavior, and the real resource for a giveaway.

**Prioritize motion when relevance and readability are equal.** Search for real typing, scrolling, UI flows, demonstrations and changing results; inspect playback and record the useful action's source bounds. Allocate the strongest relevant actions and most useful variety to the first 3–5 seconds. Supply different views/details/scales, including clips suitable for full-screen use. When static proof is stronger, propose a slow safe zoom/reframe and name the detail that must stay readable. Animated stills are not proof of app interaction.

Source music and SFX with the visual assets. Brandon's default requires a playable instrumental music bed unless he explicitly opts out. Index its provenance, duration, musical in-point and observed accents; choose distinct effects for actual actions and a strong opening. Follow the playbook's provider fallback when needed. Never silently omit music or count a queued generation as a finished audio asset.

Apply the playbook's **noun-match rejection gate** before selection: identify the exact focal detail, how it shows the spoken action/relationship, a stronger alternative considered, and the actual phone-size crop check. A Wikipedia definition of “judge” does not explain an AI judging arguments. A whole page with unreadable text is not evidence merely because its URL is real. Reject generic text cards that just restate the line when a useful action, object or mechanism can be shown.

Use the [asset-request template](../../templates/asset-request.json) to record a missing shot. The [public capture example](../../examples/public-source-capture.json) demonstrates the real helper input; replace its source with one relevant to the current claim.

Capture public sources with the existing `capture_evidence.cjs` helper through `reel.py run capture -- ...`. Authenticated content needs the actual connected browser/appropriate CLI. Inspect every captured image; a login wall, irrelevant page or URL without a file is not B-roll. Preserve the unaltered master and source identity, then crop/highlight separately.

Write source bounds in master seconds and placement in final-reel seconds. Save local path, hash, source URL/ID, capture method, useful claim/detail, proof limits, reuse basis and visual-inspection status. Reject unrelated impressive-looking screens. Keep alternatives in the source shortlist and selected files in the active asset index.

If no real asset answers an abstract beat, give `reel-generate` a specific missing explanation, required count/layout and acceptance checks. A missing proof shot cannot be solved by generating fake proof. Ready means the selected local files were actually opened and the editor can explain their intended placement.
